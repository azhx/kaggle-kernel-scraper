# kaggle-notebook-scraper
WIP. Scraping Kaggle Notebooks to figure out what tools people are using to solve problems.

`scraper.py` is a script that currently scrapes the COVID-19 Research Challenge kernels and writes out a metadata dataframe with details about every public notebook.

Next steps are to use the links in `covid-kernels.csv` to scrape the actual notebooks themselves.
